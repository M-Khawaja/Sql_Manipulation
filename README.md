# Sql_Manipulation

## Overview
This project involves cleaning and preparing a customer marketing dataset for analysis. The dataset contains demographic and spending information, and the goal is to preprocess the data for future analysis or modelling. The project includes handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, creating new features, and managing outliers.

## Key Steps

Data Import: Load data into PostgreSQL.

Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates, create new columns (e.g., Age, Total Children), and handle missing values.

Outlier Management: Detect and cap outliers in Age and Income.

Export: Save the cleaned dataset to a new CSV file.

## Files Included

cleaning.sql: SQL script to clean and preprocess the data.

marketing_campaign.csv: Original dataset.

cleaned_marketing_campaign.csv: Cleaned dataset for analysis.
